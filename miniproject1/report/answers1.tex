In the case of constant input and constant threshold ($x(t)=x_o$ and $\theta(t) = \theta^*$), the BCM learning rule has the form: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\omega_i}{dt} = \eta x_i(y^2-y\theta)= Aw^2-Bw
\end{equation}
where A and B are constants. Here, the main problem of this learning rule would be that the weights grow without bound, so they can not converge to stable values.
